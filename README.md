# ðŸ§© Component Architecture

## `PatientForm.tsx`
Handles:
- Form data input and validation
- Real-time emit of typing and form submission events

## `StaffView.tsx`
Handles:
- Receiving data from socket events
- Animated typing indicator
- Structured preview of submitted/typing form data
# ðŸ”„ Real-Time Synchronization Flow

## 1. Typing
- On any form input change in `PatientForm`, emits `typing` event via socket
- `StaffView` listens to `typing` and updates view + starts dot animation

## 2. Submit
- On form submit, emits `submitForm` event via socket
- `StaffView` displays form as submitted, stops animation

## 3. Timeout
- If no update in 10 seconds, status resets to `Inactive`

# ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Design Considerations

## âœ… Responsive Layout
- Mobile-first with full-width input fields on smaller devices
- 2-column layout for larger screens (e.g. Emergency contact fields side by side)
- Clear focus and spacing with consistent padding using Tailwind

## âœ… Accessibility
- Placeholder text in muted gray for better form usability
- Clear label associations and required field markings

## ðŸ§  Bonus Features
- Bouncing dot animation on "Typing..." status
- Conditional input for "Other Language"
- Responsive layout for form inputs
